# This is an example of using test fixtures
======

###### They define the following behaviour:

```before```- Runs one time BEFORE the entire test suite that is defined by the ```describe``` annotation.

```after``` - Runs one time AFTER the entire test suite that is defined by the ```describe``` annotation.

```beforeEach```- Runs one time BEFORE each test (```test```, ```it``` annotation).

```afterEach``` - Runs one time AFTER each test (```test```, ```it``` annotation).


as you can see in the example - test fixtures can be either async of not.
